  description: Coinjoin is a method of mixing cryptocurrency tokens or coins, where
    two or more user transactions are combined into a single transaction on the blockchain,
    with multiple inputs and outputs. The concept behind that methodology is to obfuscate
    the link between an input and an output that would otherwise be apparent in a
    standard, single-user transaction. The coinjoin methodology is open-source and
    integrated into some software wallets, and is also available for use via a hosted
    online service.
