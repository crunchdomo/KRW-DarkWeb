    ns1:description """An unprecedented high-level master narrative of America\\'s intelligence wars, from the only person ever to helm both CIA and NSA, at a time of heinous new threats and wrenching change
 
For General Michael Hayden, playing to the edge means playing so close to the line that you get chalk dust on your cleats. Otherwise, by playing back, you may protect yourself, but you will be less successful in protecting America. Play to the edge was Hayden\\'s guiding principle when he ran the National Security Agency, and it remained so when he ran CIA.  In his view, many shortsighted and uninformed people are quick to criticize, and this book will give them much to chew on but little easy comfort; it is an unapologetic insider\\'s look told from the perspective of the people who faced awesome responsibilities head on, in the moment.
 
How did American intelligence respond to terrorism, a major war and the most sweeping technological revolution in the last 500 years?  What was NSA before 9/11 and how did it change in its aftermath?  Why did NSA begin the controversial terrorist surveillance program that included the acquisition of domestic phone records? What else was set in motion during this period that formed the backdrop for the infamous Snowden revelations in 2013?  
 
As Director of CIA in the last three years of the Bush administration,  Hayden had to deal with the rendition, detention and interrogation program as bequeathed to him by his predecessors. He also had to ramp up the agency to support its role in the targeted killing program that began to dramatically increase in July 2008. This was a time of great crisis at CIA, and some agency veterans have credited Hayden with actually saving the agency. He himself won\\'t go that far, but he freely acknowledges that CIA helped turn the American security establishment into the most effective killing machine in the history of armed conflict.
 
For 10 years, then, General Michael Hayden was a participant in some of the most telling events in the annals of American national security. General Hayden\\'s goals are in writing this book are simple and unwavering: No apologies. No excuses. Just what happened. And why. As he writes, There is a story here that deserves to be told, without varnish and without spin. My view is my view, and others will certainly have different perspectives, but this view deserves to be told to create as complete a history as possible of these turbulent times. I bear no grudges, or at least not many, but I do want this to be a straightforward and readable history for that slice of the American population who depend on and appreciate intelligence, but who do not have the time to master its many obscure characteristics.

    ns1:description """Now in its third edition, this best-selling book continues to bring you some of the best thinking on how to apply Oracle Database to produce scalable applications that perform well and deliver correct results. Tom Kyte and Darl Kuhn share a simple philosophy: you can treat Oracle as a black box and just stick data into it, or you can understand how it works and exploit it as a powerful computing environment.

â  The strain

Jack Herer is a sativa-dominant cannabis strain that has gained much renown. Combining a Haze hybrid with a Northern Lights #5 and Shiva Skunk cross, Sensi Seeds created Jack Herer hoping to capture both the cerebral elevation associated with sativas and the heavy resin production of indicas.  Consumers typically describe this 55% sativa hybrid as blissful, clear-headed, and creative.

Jack Herer was created in the Netherlands in the mid-1990s where it was later distributed by Dutch pharmacies as a recognized medical-grade strain. Since then, the spicy, pine-scented sativa has taken home numerous awards for its quality and potency.

Create reusable patterns and modules by leveraging the new features of Node.js
This unique guide will help you get the most out of Node.js by providing a series of patterns and techniques of the Node.JS ecosystem
Illustrative examples will help you get a clear practical understanding.

Book Description

Node.js is a massively popular software platform that lets you use JavaScript to easily create scalable server-side applications. It allows you to create efficient code, enabling a more sustainable way of writing software made of only one language across the full stack, along with extreme levels of reusability, pragmatism, simplicity, and collaboration. Node.js is revolutionizing the web and the way people and companies create their software.

In this book, we will take you on a journey across various ideas and components, and the challenges you would commonly encounter while designing and developing software using the Node.js platform. You will also discover the Node.js way of dealing with design and coding decisions.

The book kicks off by exploring the basics of Node.js describing it\\'s asynchronous single-threaded architecture and the main design patterns. It then shows you how to master the asynchronous control flow patterns, the stream library and it culminates into a detailed list of Node.js implementations of the most common design patterns as well as some specific design patterns that are exclusive to the Node.js world. Lastly, it dives into more advanced concepts like modules, Universal Javascript and scalability and it\\'s meant to conclude the journey by giving the reader all the necessary concepts to be able to build an enterprise grade application using Node.js.

What you will learn

Design and implement a series of server-side JavaScript patterns so you understand why and when to apply them in different use case scenarios
Leverage all the patterns that allow you to take advantage of features from callbacks to the futuristic async-await syntax.
Identify the most important concerns and apply unique tricks to achieve higher scalability and modularity in your Node.js application
Untangle your modules by organizing and connecting them coherently
Reuse well-known solutions to circumvent common design and coding issues
Explore the new trend of Universal JavaScript that allows you to easily share code with the browser, avoiding duplication between back-end and front-end code
