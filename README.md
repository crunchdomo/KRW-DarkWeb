To load the files into protege, open the file KRW-DarkWeb\DarkWebOnto\v3\DM-merged-onto-v3.ttl, then in the imported ontologies section manually load in DM-merged-onto-v1.ttl from the v1 file. 

DAOV3.rdf and dwva-taxonomy-v03 should load automatically, but in case of an error they can be found and loaded from the v3 folder.
